# Config

To install the MUD command line interface (CLI) into your environment, run this command:

```sh copy
pnpm install -g @latticexyz/cli@next
```

Alternatively, you can install `@latticexyz/cli` as part of a Node project, in which case you can access it from the project's root using either `pnpm mud` or `./node_modules/.bin/mud`

Once you installed `mud`, run this command as a sanity check:

```sh copy
mud hello `whoami`
```

To get the list of available functions, run:

```sh copy
mud --help
```
