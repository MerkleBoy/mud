# Introduction

The client has to know the content of the tables.
There are two ways to achieve this:

1. We can synchronize directly from the blockchain.
   This method has the advantage of getting trusted results, because by definition whatever is written on the blockchain is correct.
   However, it requires the client to use [`eth_getFilterLogs`](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/eth-getfilterlogs-1) going all the way back to when the `World` was deployed.
   This can be slow and expensive.
1. We can synchronize the initial state from an indexer.
   This method has the advantage of being quick and cheap (only one query), but it relies on a centralized component.
1. Use a module (either [`KeysInTable`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/packages/world-modules/src/modules/keysintable/KeysInTableModule.sol) or [`KeysWithValue`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/packages/world-modules/src/modules/keyswithvalue/KeysWithValueModule.sol)).
   This method allows for quick (a few function calls) synchronization from the trusted blockchain.
   However, it significantly increases the gas cost of _any_ transaction that writes to a table.
   Also, the `World` owner needs to implement the module.
